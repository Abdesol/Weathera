# Weathera
Weathera is a weather app that works on Android phone. It is made using C# framework called xamarin.<br>
This app will automatically detect your current location and also you can view other cities weather status.<br>
The last city you viewed will be saved as the default location.
If you are disconnected from internet, still you can use the app. You can view the last refresh you did in the app.
